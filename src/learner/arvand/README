Arvand uses LAMA's translator to translate
STRIPS to SAS+ representation. Apparently 
this translator is non-deterministic and generates
different results each time used. This might 
be related to the containers used in the preprocessor.
Therefore, although this version of Arvand 
uses a fixed random seed number,
it still can generate non-deterministic results.
